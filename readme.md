# Eagle Reserve
Eagle Reserve is a responsive, full stack web application that is designed to improve Apple Valley High Schoolâ€™s current system by which teachers make reservations to use computer carts, labs, study spaces, and other equipment. The application will display reservations in a user-friendly, clear manner while eliminating the ability for teachers to overwrite reservations. The application will also allow the admins to oversee the reservation process rather than spending large amounts of time managing reservation issues.
